						SpyFy: Web-based Surveillance Camera

		The objective of this project is to create a web-based surveillance camera system for homeowners or small business owners 
		for their protection and security. Nowadays, having a security camera system is extremely vital due to an increase in home 
		invasions in neighbourhoods. SpyFy will allow our clients to select from a range of actions to be performed if they suspect 
		an intruder at the front or the back doors.
