					**	SpyFy: Web-based Surveillance Camera**
					
The purpose of this document is to introduce SpyFy, which is a Web-based Surveillance Camera that our 
team would be working on for this semester. Our team consists of three members, Alina Ahmad, Raiyan Hasan 
and Tochukwu Iroakazi. Our team will be creating a camera system that will be responsible for monitoring 
and record-keeping for intruders. The camera will detect if a human is in the range and it will capture a 
picture and send it to the owner of the camera system.
