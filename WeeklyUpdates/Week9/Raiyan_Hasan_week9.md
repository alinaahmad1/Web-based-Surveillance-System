Group number: 5

Student name: Raiyan Hasan

1) How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)

      I spent about 8 hours on the lab

2) Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:* (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)

      We did some research and testing with the communication protocols concerning our project and finished working on the design report.

3) What did you accomplish this week? (Be specific)

      The design report was completed 

  Got an idea of how to connect the hardware that we ordered

      Did testing on our communication protocols.

4) How do you feel about your progress? (brief, free-form reflection)

      I feel like we made okay progress this week but I think we could have done more as we are behind.
  
      we ran into issues with my Raspberry Pi not working so had to get it replaced.

5) What are you planning to do next week? (give specific goals)

      Next week, our team will be meeting everyday in the lab room to make our surveillance system.

      Hopefully by the end of this week we have our code done and see how to make our code communicate to the databases. 
      
      We will aslo setup our hardware components so we can start   testing them individually.

6) Is anything blocking you that you need from others? (What do you need from whom)

      We are getting on track now, I need our team to come together in order for us to setup the components.
