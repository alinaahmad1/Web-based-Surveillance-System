This week our group made significant progress on deciding and brainstorming ideas for our project on what we should be doing. 
The idea we currently are strongly leaning towards is a Surveillance robot, which is mobile. 
The idea is to be able to create a safe and secure enviornment.
We worked on the lab 3 as a team, and struggled completing the last exercise, which was importing and reading data onto the firebase.
Overall we made good progress on the project finalising a concrete idea.
